            "Step 1: How do I run my YouTube channel and how do I make money from it?\n",
            "Step 2: In this video I'm going to quickly take you through all the steps.\n",
            "Step 3: So if you are thinking of setting up a YouTube channel, you'll understand all the things you need to think about.\n",
            "Step 4: It's not particularly complicated and I'll also tell you about the course that I run.\n",
            "Step 5: So what I'm going to cover in this quick video is first of all the steps I take and it's not that many.\n",
            "Step 6: There's one really important thing to think about.\n",
            "Step 7: I'm going to show you the equipment that I use.\n",
            "Step 8: It's very cheap to start up a channel.\n",
            "Step 9: You don't need to spend a lot of money and even now probably the total expender is less than nearly probably even less than a thousand pounds.\n",
            "Step 10: You've got to have a good idea and I'm going to tell you that even today if you come up with a good idea and put it out on YouTube, you can still do really well.\n",
            "Step 11: Workers can get moving.\n",
            "Step 12: It does take a bit of time but it definitely can work and I've worked with organizations that have done it.\n",
            "Step 13: I'm going to tell you how you generate an income and you're going to be really surprised.\n",
            "Step 14: It's not about necessarily the money that comes from YouTube.\n",
            "Step 15: You can have a really small channel for say a language teacher where you put up videos and you only get a couple of hundred people watching them but in that video you advertise yourself as a teacher and people can click on the link and contact you and you can do really well.\n",
            "Step 16: I have quite a few teachers that have done that even with just a couple of hundred people watching their YouTube channel.\n",
            "Step 17: They are generating a really good income because they're getting loads of private language classes and then the final thing I'm going to do is I'm going to tell you about my course in case you're interested in doing it.\n",
            "Step 18: So you can see the steps on the screen.\n",
            "Step 19: Obviously I think I've an idea.\n",
            "Step 20: I then study it and I've often done some actual classes with a particular technology that I want to use.\n",
            "Step 21: I then plan my video.\n",
            "Step 22: I then do the recording.\n",
            "Step 23: I always do it in little bits and I put them all together.\n",
            "Step 24: I then edit it.\n",
            "Step 25: That's a really important aspect of it and obviously the better you get at editing the more or the better quality your video will become but the most important thing is the magic I do at the end.\n",
            "Step 26: Now when I put the video up onto YouTube there are certain things that I do and that's one of the key parts of this course.\n",
            "Step 27: I'm going to show you how you make sure that YouTube knows exactly what your video is about and there's a number of things that you can do to do that.\n",
            "Step 28: Now what that means is that when someone searches for a video your video will be suggested by YouTube because YouTube says yep that's what that video is about.\n",
            "Step 29: That's the one to show to everybody.\n",
            "Step 30: That's where the magic takes place.\n",
            "Step 31: That's taken me years of studying.\n",
            "Step 32: I still study it now.\n",
            "Step 33: I try to pick up on all the latest things that are going on and it really is the thing that makes the difference.\n",
            "Step 34: The great thing about YouTube is that you don't really need to spend a lot of money.\n",
            "Step 35: You need a computer.\n",
            "Step 36: You need a webcam.\n",
            "Step 37: You need a microphone.\n",
            "Step 38: You need some lighting and you need to be able to edit the video.\n",
            "Step 39: YouTube channels free to upload your video so there's no cost there.\n",
            "Step 40: Now obviously what you can do is start cheap\n",
            "Step 41: and that's exactly what I did and really just use basically the computer that I had and the equipment that I had.\n",
            "Step 42: And then I started to spend more money.\n",
            "Step 43: I bought a better microphone.\n",
            "Step 44: I bought a better webcam.\n",
            "Step 45: I bought some lighting.\n",
            "Step 46: But even today I've spent less than a thousand pounds on everything.\n",
            "Step 47: And at the beginning I literally didn't spend anything.\n",
            "Step 48: I didn't need to.\n",
            "Step 49: I had a computer and I had a webcam and a microphone already.\n",
            "Step 50: Probably the first thing that you would do if you were going to spend some money is probably buy yourself a good microphone.\n",
            "Step 51: It does make a difference and you get a good microphone these days for around about 60 pounds.\n",
            "Step 52: The one I use slightly more expensive but actually these days there are some that are even cheaper that are just as good.\n",
            "Step 53: So it's not particularly expensive to start and that's one of the reasons why I would encourage people to think about doing it because it's a great way of starting a business and if it doesn't work you've not lost a lot of money.\n",
            "Step 54: The key thing is to have a good idea.\n",
            "Step 55: You need to think niche.\n",
            "Step 56: It can definitely be in the area where there are already videos.\n",
            "Step 57: You don't have to do something completely original but you need to find a new angle on it.\n",
            "Step 58: Remember there are billions of people searching for videos.\n",
            "Step 59: So you've always got a good chance if you've got a particular niche.\n",
            "Step 60: You've got to be a bit patient.\n",
            "Step 61: It does take time to build up the channel but as I've said if you're clever with your advertising within the videos that you make you will instantly begin to make money from YouTube.\n",
            "Step 62: People think of the income from YouTube as the most important thing but yes it's vital to have a good idea, to have a good angle and probably it's also important to be quite consistent so once you've decided what you want to do, what you want to focus on in your videos stick to it.\n",
            "Step 63: That's really really important because that way you'll build up a following around that particular topic and theme.\n",
            "Step 64: So of course you can generate good money from YouTube.\n",
            "Step 65: There's no doubt about it if you get a really popular channel, I mean if you get perhaps a hundred thousand subscribers and people regularly watching your channel you could earn thousands from your channel.\n",
            "Step 66: For me the money that I get from YouTube is not insignificant.\n",
            "Step 67: It's a decent amount of money but the key thing really is all the business that it generates around it.\n",
            "Step 68: So I get lots of opportunities to do consultancy work for companies.\n",
            "Step 69: I often work with companies that are developing software.\n",
            "Step 70: They want me to trial and test and pilot their material, their software etc.\n",
            "Step 71: I get lots of one-on-one training around things like Camtasia.\n",
            "Step 72: I've even actually worked with a couple of quite well-known people.\n",
            "Step 73: I've done obviously training in using things like Camtasia for organizations going and helping them to build training courses, law firms, banking firms, not necessarily always people working in education but often in training, company training.\n",
            "Step 74: I get lots of talks, I get opportunities to do presentations and talks around using technology and language teaching.\n",
            "Step 75: I also even get the opportunity to write articles about the use of technology.\n",
            "Step 76: So that YouTube channel ends up generating lots of business for me and lots of nice variety of things.\n",
            "Step 77: So the YouTube channel, yes there is some money coming in there.\n",
            "Step 78: You have to get to a certain number of subscribers before you can monetize your channel.\n",
            "Step 79: But that really doesn't matter as I've said right from the start even before you monetize your channel, make sure that in your videos you're pointing out, let's say you're a language teacher.\n",
            "Step 80: Listen, if you want language lessons with me, click on the link below.\n",
            "Step 81: You can generate an income that way almost immediately from your channel.\n",
            "Step 82: And as I've said, I've worked with several teachers and they've all managed to achieve that.\n",
            "Step 83: Just one really important point here, don't be impressed with the channels that you see that have millions of views.\n",
            "Step 84: Often they've spent a lot of money on advertising.\n",
            "Step 85: I know that because I've done some consultancy with a few of those organizations.\n",
            "Step 86: I've never spent a penny on advertising my YouTube channel.\n",
            "Step 87: Everything's been generated by me making videos and then sharing them on Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook.\n",
            "Step 88: So you're not competing with people that get 3 million views of a video.\n",
            "Step 89: What you want to do is build up and get a regular two, three, 400 people watching your videos and you will be able to generate an income off the back of that.\n",
            "Step 90: If you've put something in the video to advertise whatever it is that you are offering, that is the key thing.\n",
            "Step 91: So the course I run has got two parts.\n",
            "Step 92: First of all, there's a webinar.\n",
            "Step 93: That webinar lasts about an hour and a half.\n",
            "Step 94: There's often a lot of questions to answer.\n",
            "Step 95: So I kind of present the key things that you need to understand to run our YouTube channel.\n",
            "Step 96: And I give away a lot of secrets, a lot of the secrets.\n",
            "Step 97: And I do recommend one piece of software.\n",
            "Step 98: It's around five or six dollars, the one that I use.\n",
            "Step 99: There are a few that you can choose.\n",
            "Step 100: If you do the course, you'll see why that piece of software is so useful.\n",
            "Step 101: So you do a webinar with me, which I give you a recording of so you can access and play that recording back.\n",
            "Step 102: And I also give you access to a little course that I've built where I've collected together some of my own videos on how to build a channel, but also collected together some other videos from other people that I found really useful that kind of goes through all the different things that I've explained in the webinar, but in a little bit more detail so you can study in them and work at your own pace.\n",
            "Step 103: Between those two components, you will have a solid grounding and be able to get going.\n",
            "Step 104: Now it does mean, of course, if you start your own YouTube channel, you do need to keep up with all the changes because things do change.\n",
            "Step 105: I promise you that would give you a really solid understanding of what it's going to cost you, how it's done and how to be effective right from the start.\n",
            "Step 106: I can't emphasize how important that is.\n",
            "Step 107: Really hope you decide to join me.\n",
            "Step 108: Details are below and we will be running a course very soon.\n"
